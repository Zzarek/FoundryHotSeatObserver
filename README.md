# FoundryHotSeatObserver
This module was designed with the intent to assit players who play in-person. Perhaps the DM has a horizontally placed screen with plexiglass on it, or perhaps the DM has a screen mounted in view of the table. Either way, multiple players may need to share a screen.

Classically hotseat refered to players taking turns at a keyboard, so in the same vein, thats what is happening here. When a player's turn is over and initiative is incremented, this module will automatically change the controlled token and selected character along with changes in initiative.



## Current Use Configuration
 
 Currently to use this module you need to add a player named either 'Observer' or 'Hot Seat'. This player should be assigned as owner for every character you want the player to access.

## Potential Future Features
 1. Ideally configuring the name of the hot seat role would be a viable option, as opposed to a pair of hardcoded names
 2. Allowing tihs module to extend into players running multiple characters split screen or not (also on an optional basis)
 
## Other Notes
This has only been tested in the WHRP4 game system, though there is no reason to assume it wouldn't be universal that I can see.
